# 🚀 Project Initialization Guide – Friends Performance Site (Replit)

## 💪 Purpose

This guide defines the step-by-step workflow to properly initialize and begin development of the "Friends" live performance website project using Replit.

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Initialization

### ✅ Step 1: Understand the Project Context

Before writing any code, make sure you have a full understanding of the project goals, style, and development expectations. Review the following files:

* Read `README.md` – Understand the project vision, architecture, and current state
* Read `/context/design-principles.md` – Understand the UI/UX philosophy and constraints
* Read `/docs/coding-best-practices.md` – Understand development standards, TDD workflow, and testing practices
* Read `/test-reports/README.md` – Understand current test coverage and testing philosophy

Also, Replit must **maintain and regularly update** the following documentation:

* `logs.md` – Log `console.log()` for troubleshooting
* `tasks.md` – Task report with status of completed, in-progress, and upcoming work

### 🧪 Step 2: Follow a TDD (Test-Driven Development) Workflow

1. **Ask to create a test file** for the feature or component you're working on.
2. **Write a failing test** that clearly describes the expected behavior.
3. **Run the test** and ensure it fails (confirming the test is valid).
4. **Write production code** to pass the test.
5. **Refactor if needed**, and re-run the test to confirm it's fixed.

Repeat for each feature/component.

### 🏗 Step 3: Set Up Folder Structure

```
/friends-performance-site/
|
├── index.html
├── show.html
├── cast.html
├── messages.html
├── fun.html
├── admin.html            ← optional
|
├── /assets/
│   ├── /images/          ← cast photos, poster
│   ├── /videos/          ← promo video files
│   └── /css/
│       └── style.css
|
├── /scripts/
│   ├── main.js
│   └── quote.js
|
├── .env                  ← for dev flags
├── README.md             ← project overview
├── logs.md               ← daily log of progress and notes
├── tasks.md              ← ongoing task tracker
└── .replit               ← config for Replit to run `npx serve .`
```

---

### ⚙️ Step 4: Replit Configuration

* Create a new Replit project using the HTML, CSS, JS template
* Set `.replit` to: `run = "npx serve ."`
* Add `.env` file for environment variables (e.g., `DEV=true`)
* Link Bulma CSS and other libraries via CDN if necessary

### 🛠 Step 5: Feature Development

Use the checklist below to organize development. Prioritize `index.html`, `show.html`, and `cast.html` for MVP:

## ⚠️ Best Practices

* Store secrets (e.g., Formspree keys) in `.env`
* Admin and fan features are optional after core MVP
* Use Git + GitHub for version control
* Final deployment will use Cloudflare Pages
